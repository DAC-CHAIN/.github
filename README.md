# DAC Blockchain

**Solving Blockchainâ€™s Adoption Dilemma**  
DAC is a Layer-1 blockchain built to align investor rewards with stable, predictable costs for businesses by means of a dual-asset design and quantum-resistant security.

## Features  
- **Dual Asset Design**  
  - _DACT_ (governance token): required reward DAC miners and investors  
  - _DACC_ (currency coin): mined by DAC Nodes to stabilize transaction fees  
- **Predictable, Low Fees**  
  Transaction costs grow only with network usage, enabling SMEs to budget confidently.  
- **Quantum-Proof Security**  
  Multi-layer cryptography (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate signatures) and quantum-resistant PoS+BFT consensus.  
- **Interoperability & Developer Tools**  
  Sharding-ready COB protocol, Layer-2 integrations (Polygon, zkSync), full smart-contract compatibility.  
- **Sustainable & Compliant**  
  Energy-efficient consensus, on-chain governance, designed for global regulatory standards.
